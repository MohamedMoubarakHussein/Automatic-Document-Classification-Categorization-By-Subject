# Intro
This project implements an Automatic Document Classification System that categorizes text documents into predefined subject categories using machine learning techniques. The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification to automatically identify and categorize documents based on their content. 

The classifier can distinguish between 5 different categories: Technology (tech) Business (business) Sports (sport) Entertainment (entertainment) Politics (politics) 
# Features 
Complete text cleaning pipeline including tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization. 
High Accuracy Classification: Achieves 98.65% accuracy on test data.
Real-time Prediction: Interactive system for classifying custom articles. 
NLP Pipeline: Uses NLTK for comprehensive text processing. 
TF-IDF Vectorization: Advanced feature extraction for better document representation. 
Confusion Matrix Visualization: Visual performance analysis of the model.

# Dataset
The project uses the BBC News Dataset (bbc.csv) containing: 2,225 articles from BBC News 5 categories: Technology, Business, Sports, Entertainment, Politics Balanced distribution across all categories Pre-labeled data for supervised learning
